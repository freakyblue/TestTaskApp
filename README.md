# SimpleLibrary

This is just a small repository to show my current app programming skills instead of a paper
application, to get a part-time job at [cathleen-scharfe.de](https://cathleen-scharfe.de).

## Task
The task is to write a inventory app with the following characteristics:
- Showing the booklist in listview
- Every book should be listed with name and author
- Clicking an entry will lead to a detailed view of it in a new screen. there name, author,
description and genre will be shown
- Clicking the `Back`-key will lead back to the listview

## Bonustask
- Beautiful design/ layout of the app
- Dynamic loading of the inventory data via XML or JSON parser
- Usage of an architekture pattern (MVC, MVVM, MVP)
